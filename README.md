# Pytorch lighting and WandB

We want to get familiar with these logging frameworks.  
As yo know, pytorch lightning is a framework which provides lots of funcionality like: multi gpu training, structural code, logging, and so on.  
We can use wandb as a replacement of a logging part in the lightning and integrate both of them to get a grea results.
